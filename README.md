# Angular First Take

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.9.

This repository contains my first Angular task focused on applying core concepts such as:

- **Interpolation**
- **Style and Class Binding**
- **One-Way and Two-Way Data Binding**
- **Event Binding**
- **Custom Pipe for Highlighting Searched Text**

It serves as a submission for my first assignment, demonstrating a basic understanding of these foundational Angular techniques.
